Are you using Daysheets for the first time on iOS and not sure where to start? Here's a quick tutorial to walk you through how to get started:

First, download the Daysheets App right in the App Store.

When you first open Daysheets it's going to prompt you to either GET STARTED or Sign In, tap Get Started, and then choose the method by which you'd like to login.

After you've done that, it will ask you to enter your full name, add a photo, your position on the tour, and your phone number.

Then, it will ask you if you'd like to enable notifications, we recommend that you do so you can stay on top of any updates pertaining to your tour.

Then it will ask you if you're an admin. Let's assume you're not and that you're being invited by someone else to join an existing tour. Tap "I'm Not an Admin".

/>

If you've received an invite code from the admin, you'll enter it here and immediately be connected to the tour. If you don't have one you can always enter one at a later time by going into your profile and entering in the Tour invite code here.

Now that you're connected to a tour there's so much you can do. Scroll through your day types, see your days in a calendar view, or even a new routing view.

Within each day you can see the following information:

Day Type (show day, day off, etc)
See hotels and lodging information
Your schedule
Flight information
Notes for each day
Car and chauffeur information
Files and Show Documents
Contacts
Addresses are actionable so you can open them in maps or even call an uber to take you to that address.

You can view other personnel on the tour and see their contact information.

If you're an admin, you send push notifications to other groups or people on the tour.

You can edit your profile and add things like passport information, frequent flier numbers, rewards numbers, dietary restrictions, and more.
