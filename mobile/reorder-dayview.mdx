With the Daysheets mobile app you can add and edit flights from on the road!

To add a new flight, start by clicking on the “+” button in the top right corner.
Choose “Add a Flight” from the menu.
From here search for the Airline you’ll be flying with, and enter the flight number.
As you search using these flight details you’ll be asked to choose the correct flight from the menu.
If all of the information that was added looks correct, click “Save” and the flight will now appear in the schedule on your day view.
