Need to add maps, menus, or other documents to your tour while on the go?

Daysheets mobile allows you to add a document to your itinerary quickly and easily.

Simply click the "+" button in the top right corner and choose "Add a Document" from the dropdown menu.

Daysheets will pull up saved files on your phone to choose from. Selecting a file from this screen will automatically add it to your tour.

To view this document, click on the "Files" tab next in the Day View.

And just like that, band and crew members can view the file directly from the Daysheets app.
