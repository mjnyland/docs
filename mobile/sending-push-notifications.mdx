Need to notify your crew about new call times, schedule edits, or other important changes on the road? Daysheets allows you to send push notifications to your crew directly from your phone.

To start, click on the "+" button in the top right corner and choose "Send a Message"

From here, choose which individuals or which group(s) you want to receive your message.

  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Now you can type your message.

Assuming the personnel you've added are connected to the tour on Daysheets, hitting "Send" will send a notification directly to their phone.
