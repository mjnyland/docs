Need to add people to a guest list while on the road? How about approving guest list requests from your band or crew? Daysheets allows you to manage your guest lists directly from your phone!

To start, click on the "Guest List" tab on the show day you're looking at. This is where you can see the number of tickets that have been approved and requested and how many are still available.

This view shows you the names of guests and whether their request has been approved, is pending, or was rejected. To filter down to specific statuses of requests, you can click on the "Pending", "Approved", or "Rejected" tabs.

You can also allow non-admins to make guest list requests for this show by toggling on the switch at the top of the screen.

Daysheets allows you to export your completed guest list to either a PDF or CSV file. Click on the three dots at the top right corner and choose "Export List Settings". You can now choose which information to include on your export by using the toggles. Lastly, click "Export as CSV" or "Export as PDF" in the top right.
