Daysheets makes it quick and easy to invite personnel. Once connected, team members returning to future tours will automatically connect, with no need to invite again.

To invite your team, go to the personnel page within a tour. From here click the “Edit Personnel Tab”, which will bring you to the edit overview:

Select one or many team members that you wish to invite. If you’re inviting one person, click “Generate Pin”. if you are selecting multiple team members, select “Generate Pins” in the header. Daysheets will generate unqiue 8-10 digit invitation codes that are specific to each team member.

Once you see an 8-10 digit pin, press the send icon to e-mail your team member sign up and connection instructions. Alternatively if you want to send all pins at once, press “E-mail unsent invites” in the header and Daysheets will send all of your invitations at once.

As team members sign up with their pins, the connection status will change from “Pending” to “Connected”.
