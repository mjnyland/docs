description: "Getting Started with Daysheets"
---

Exclusively on Daysheets, we’ve re-imagined how you build and share your travel profiles. Now your store your travel profile right on Daysheets for mobile, and share your profile with administrators when you join new tours.

To get started, fill your your travel profile in the profile section of Daysheets. Daysheets currently supports storing the following information:

Multiple Passports
Travel Profiles (Frequent flyer, seat preference, KTN, TSA, DOB)
Emergency Contacts
Dietary Restrictions
If a tour administrator has requested your travel profile, look for the bell in the top right hand corner of the iOS app. You should see a red dot on the bell, showing there is a new notification.

Once you click the bell, you should see the name of your administrator requesting your travel profile. Click on the request.

If your admin has sent a request but you don’t see it in notifications, quit the app and try opening Daysheets again.

Review the profile request, and approve which details you want to share with the tour’s administrator.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to help@daysheets.com !
