If you need to adjust a team member’s group, permissions, or visibility, click the Edit Personnel tab in the top bar. From here, click any team member, to adjust their permissions in the drawer on the right.

Basic details are displayed to other team members, you can adjust these details however you see fit.

Groups can be assigned, based on who this person travels with most frequently.

Permissions can be set to “none” if you want to hide the tour from this team member, “Read Only” if they aren’t entering information, and “Edit” if they need access to add and adjust details.

Visibility lets you control who can see what. By default, group members can only see events and reservations related to their group. If you want them to see everything, adjust Visibility etting to grant them access to all. You can also create custom visibility settings to allow them to see their group's events and reservations, as well as any other groups or individuals you assign to them.
