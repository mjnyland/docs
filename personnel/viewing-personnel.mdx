To view your personnel, click “Personnel” in the top left corner in the tour menu. If you’ve already added team members to your tour, they will be displayed in the overview:

Let’s look at Emily Taylor in the overview. We can see Emily’s position, group, email, phone number, invite status, and we see that there are passport, frequent flyer numbers, emergency contacts, and dietary restrictions stored for this person.

If we need to adjust any of Emily’s information information, click on Emily’s name, and use the drawer on the right hand side to make any edits.

We’ve introduced travel profile requests, which allows you to request travel profile information directly from your team members. You can learn more about travel profile requests by clicking here , or scrolling further down in this post.
