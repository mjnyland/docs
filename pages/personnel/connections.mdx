Connecting with your personnel is essential functionality. As Daysheets continues to evolve, so will the capabilities of how to manage and maintain your connected personnel. Review the guide below to understand how personnel management works.

Understanding how connections work:

When you invite someone to join a tour, you are establishing a connection with that person, similar to a friend request on Facebook, or accepting a linkedin request.

Once a team member accepts your connection request, they can view or edit the tour you’ve added them to now, or any tours you add them to in the future. Since the connection is between you and the person, and not a specific tour, you can add this person to future tours, and maintain a single travel profile that carries over to those tours.

Anyone who has edit access to your tour, can also view and edit any travel profiles for individuals who have access to to that tour.

What happens when i or someone on my team builds a team member’s travel profile?

With Daysheets, you can create a profile for your newly connected team member, allowing you to add passport details, frequent flyer information, dietary restrictions and more. This information is only viewable by you, and any individuals on the tour who you’ve given edit permission to.

Since a travel profile is for a team member that you are connected with, you own and control that travel profile. Even if someone on your team has edit permissions and adds passport details for your band and crew members, those passport details are still owned by you.

Let’s review an example to understand how this works:

The PM (Production Manager) creates a tour

The PM adds and connects with their Production Coordinator, who has edit permissions

The PM adds and connects with their Monitor & FOH Engineers, who have read permissions

The PM creates a travel profile for the Monitor Engineer

The Production Coordinator creates a travel profile for the FOH Engineer

Who owns the travel profile information that was created by the PM and the Coordinator?

In this example, the PM owns the travel profiles for both the Monitor and Front of House Engineers. Here’s why:

In the event where you need to replace your Coordinator, you would still expect to have all of the travel profile information in Daysheets for both engineers, the incoming Coordinator would pickup where the previous Coordinator left off.
This also gives you exclusive administration over sensitive information. When you remove the outbound Coordinator from your tour, they can no longer edit, or view the travel profiles associated with your connections.
Finally, if you create a tour in the future with the same FOH or Monitor Engineer, but a different Coordinator, you would realistically want the travel profile for the engineers to carry over to the new tour.
What happens if i allow my Production Coordinator to invite others to my tour?

In the manage personnel view, you can use the toggle switch to allow that individual to create and invite team members to your tour. Please review the information below, it’s extremely important you understand how to respect sensitive information. This feature should only be used if you understand how this impacts access to privileged details.

When given invite permission, the Production Coordinator will be able to add to new individuals to your tour, and will also be able to add your existing connected personnel, who may not already be on the tour.
When the Production Coordinator creates and invites new personnel to Daysheets, the invitee will be connecting with you, since you created the tour. This means the new personnel member can be used across any future tours you create, and you own their travel profile.
When the the Production Coordinator wants to add a personnel member that you’ve previously connected with through Daysheets, they simply need to search for their name to add them to the tour.

Please note, that this means your Coordinator can add anyone you’ve connected with across many tours, which in turn would also give them access to see any travel profile details for that person that have been added by you, or different editor that you may have been working with previously.
In short:

Enabling someone on your team to invite others to your tour, allows them to create contacts that will be invited to connect with you, and will allow the assigned admin to add any of your connected personnel and their travel profiles, from other tours you have in Daysheets.
