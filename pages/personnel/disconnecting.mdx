If you have a team member that has trouble seeing the tour and permissions are set correctly, you can disconnect the team member from the tour, and generate a new pin.

Sometimes team members may have created multiple accounts, and when they're logged into the wrong account, disconnecting and sending an new pin will likely solve the issue.

To Disconnect a team member:

1. Go to the Personnel Page

2. From the Overview Tab, click on the persons initials or profile picture

3. On the right hand drawer, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and look for "Disconnect Personnel"

4. Once disconnected, you will be able to generate a new 8 digit pin, and send to them to re-connect to the tour.

That's it!
