Data Encryption At Daysheets, we employ robust encryption methods to protect your data. Your information is encoded using industry standard encryption techniques, ensuring that sensitive data such as flight details, hotel bookings, and personal information remain secure from unauthorized access.

Controlled Access Access to your travel profiles on Daysheets is tightly controlled by your tour. The only individuals who can view or modify this information are the tour's admin, and those specifically delegated by them. This approach mirrors the traditional method of managing tours via Google Sheets, or competitive softwares, where access is selectively granted.
