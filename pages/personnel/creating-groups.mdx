## Creating an account

Daysheets allows you to add as many groups to your tour as needed. Groups are typically used when travel parties exceed 11 people to help keep logistics organized, and deliver personalized itineraries to different groups. When first setting up your personnel, select whether or not you want to use groups. If you don’t want to use groups, you can skip to Add & import Personnel.

To get started, select “Create Groups”. Give the group a name such as Crew Party, and give the group an initial, like “C”. This is the keyboard shortcut associated with the group. You can then select what color you want to assign to this group.

Permissions can be set to “none” if you want to hide the tour from this group, “Read Only” if they aren’t entering information, and “Edit” if they need access to add and adjust details. Anyone added to this group will receive those permissions by default. Permissions can be adjusted individually for anyone in the group without it affecting the rest of the group.

Visibility lets you control who see’s what. By default, group members can only see events and reservations that pertain to their group. If you want them to see everything, adjust Visibility to grant the group access to all. You can also create custom visibility settings to allow this group to see their group's events and reservations, as well as any other groups or individuals you assign to them.

Travel Profiles allow you to request personnel details from anyone joining the group. When a team member joins this group, they will receive a notification to share their travel profiles with you, which will automatically store that information to be used for quick reference, or to export a personnel grid.

Once you’ve setup your group, press Save. You can add as many groups as you’d like, before moving to populating the groups with personnel.
