We'll create a ground transfer for the crew, timed around their venue load-in. We'll use the navigation above the grid to add a day preview, for easier transfer scheduling.

To get started, press ⌘+T to move to the Transfers view. you can also use the blue + button in the top right, and click Transfers. Since we want to add a transfer around an event, press the blue check button above the grid. These buttons allow you to add a preview of your day within the transfer grid, so you can transfer schedules accordingly:

Click the blue departures button to preview departing flight information, to setup transfers around departure.

We can see that load in takes place at 7:30AM, so we should setup a transfer at 7:00AM for the crew. Using the entry field in the bottom, enter the following details to create a transfer:

Click on “Label” to give the ride a name, such as “Crew to Load In” then press tab
Add a departure time, by entering a time. You can enter 7A and press tab or 1900 and tab, Daysheets will automatically format the time.
Search for a departure location. Use the google maps search to add a location, or use shortcuts to find relevant locations:
Type H for hotel, and any hotels for that day will be listed as a suggested location. Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate hotel and press tab.
Type V for venue, and any venues associated with the day will be listed under suggested locations.
If you’re searching for any other location, simply type in an address or location, and select the correct result.
Enter your arrival location the same way you searched for the departure location. Press tab.
Daysheets will calculate your arrival time, using Google Maps, but you may want to adjust this to account for traffic. Press tab.
In ‘Passengers’, search for passengers to add to this ride. you can search for individuals or groups. Once you’ve added the passengers riding in this transfer, press tab.
The contact field allows you to assign a primary passenger. If you have a phone number associated with the primary passenger, the contact number field will automatically be populated. this field is optional, when you’re ready to proceed, press tab.
