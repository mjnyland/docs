We'll create a ground transfer for the crew, timed around their venue load-in.
We'll use the navigation above the grid to add a day preview, for easier
transfer scheduling.

To get started, press âŒ˜+T to move to the Transfers view. you can also use the
blue + button in the top right, and click Transfers. Since we want to add a
transfer around an event, press the blue check button above the grid. These
buttons allow you to add a preview of your day within the transfer grid, so you
can transfer schedules accordingly:

Click the blue departures button to preview departing flight information, to
setup transfers around departure.

We can see that load in takes place at 7:30AM, so we should setup a transfer at
7:00AM for the crew. Using the entry field in the bottom, enter the following
details to create a transfer:

1. Click on "Label" to give the ride a name, such as "Crew to Load In" then
   press tab
2. Add a departure time, by entering a time. You can enter 7A and press tab or
   1900 and tab, Daysheets will automatically format the time.
3. Search for a departure location. Use the google maps search to add a
   location, or use shortcuts to find relevant locations:
   - Type H for hotel, and any hotels for that day will be listed as a
     suggested location. Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate hotel and
     press tab.
   - Type V for venue, and any venues associated with the day will be listed
     under suggested locations.
   - If you're searching for any other location, simply type in an address or
     location, and select the correct result.
4. Enter your arrival location the same way you searched for the departure
   location. Press tab.
5. Daysheets will calculate your arrival time, using Google Maps, but you may
   want to adjust this to account for traffic. Press tab.
6. In 'Passengers', search for passengers to add to this ride. you can search
   for individuals or groups. Once you've added the passengers riding in this
   transfer, press tab.
7. The contact field allows you to assign a primary passenger. If you have a
   phone number associated with the primary passenger, the contact number field
   will automatically be populated. this field is optional, when you're ready
   to proceed, press tab.
8. Specify the transfer type, such as 'Transit Van' or '2 SUV's'. Pressing tab
   takes you to 'Save'.
9. Press Save, your ride is now created.

Daysheets allows you to export transfer grids as a customizable spreadsheet.

   end dates in the top left corner.
