Daysheets is introducing our first AI feature to make it quick and painless to
bulk add flights to your tour! Follow the guide below to get started!

Click on "Flights" in the top left-hand corner to access the flight grid. The
flight grid allows you to view all of your flights across the tour.

From the flights overview or import tab, look for the "import Flights" button
in the top right hand corner of the window.

Using the drawer on the left, drag as many itineraries as you wish into the
drag and drop zone.

We recommend uploading files that come from your travel agent that look similar
to the document on the right hand side.
