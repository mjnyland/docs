Daysheets is introducing our first AI feature to make it quick and painless to bulk add flights to your tour! Follow the guide below to get started!

Click on “Flights” in the top left-hand corner to access the flight grid. The flight grid allows you to view all of your flights across the tour.

From the flights overview or import tab, look for the “import Flights” button in the top right hand corner of the window.

Using the drawer on the left, drag as many itineraries as you wish into the drag and drop zone.

We recommend uploading files that come from your travel agent that look similar to the document on the right hand side.

Once you’ve dragged your tickets into Daysheets, press the blue “Upload and Continue Button” in the lower right hand corner.

From here you can move to the Imports tab in the top left hand corner of the flight page to view the status of your flights.

From the imports tab, you will notice three different states of the status for each ticket:

Uploading:

this means we are still sending the file from your computer to our servers. If you notice after a few minutes that the file status is still uploading, you can try quitting Daysheets and re-opening the app to see if it has moved to processing.

Processing

This means we have received the files, and are working with OpenAI to review the information on the ticket, before sending it back to your computer. This step can take anywhere from 1-3 minutes, but normally happens within 30 seconds. If you feel the file is stuck in processing, you can try quitting Daysheets and re-opening the app to see if it has moved to Ready for Review

Ready for Review

One the file has status has changed to Ready for Review, we’ve succesfully processed the information, and now you can check that we got everything right before adding to your tour!

Now you’re ready to review the imported flight!

Click the review button on the first flight under “Parsed Flights”, and check that all of the information looks accurate. If you scroll to the bottom of the drawer on the right hand side, you can press the eye ball to open a preview of the ticket within Daysheets.

If you need to edit any of the details of the flight, you can press the edit flight button to adjust flight details, passengers, record locators and seats.

Once you click add to tour, the flights will show up in the list of flights!

You’ll notice below that Passengers 1, 2, and 3 are on the same trip. If you select the check boxes next to those three trips, you will see a merge flights button appear in the top right hand corner. This will put all three passengers on the same trip, while retaining any record locators and seat information.
