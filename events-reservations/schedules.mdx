Building a schedule for the day:

Click “Edit” at the top of the schedule to edit multiple events at once. A new window will appear, allowing you to tab through creating as many events as you have on the day. The schedule will automatically sort based on the start times of the events.

Creating Templates:

You can save templates if you have a similar schedule you want to apply to multiple days. Once you’ve created a schedule you like, from the edit view; select “Save as Template” in the lower right. Give the template a name and click save.

To apply the schedule to any given day, click Edit to go into the full edit view. Select the tab that says “Templates” in the top right, and choose the template to apply. Before it’s applied to the day, you can make any changes to the schedule. Then click save to apply the events to that day.

That’s it!
